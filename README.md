# SPICE
NASA's SPICE = Spacecraft Planet Instrument C-matrix (“Camera matrix”) 

"The Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF), acting under the directions of NASA's Planetary Science Division, has built an information system named "SPICE" to assist NASA scientists in planning and interpreting scientific observations from space-borne instruments, and to assist NASA engineers involved in modeling, planning and executing activities needed to conduct planetary exploration missions. The use of SPICE extends from mission concept development through the post-mission data analysis phase, including help with correlation of individual instrument data sets with those from other instruments on the same or on other spacecraft. ....
